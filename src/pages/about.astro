  <p>
    This website is an independent legal referral and information service designed to help individuals involved in car accidents connect with attorneys who handle personal injury and accident-related claims in Memphis, Tennessee.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are not a law firm and do not provide legal advice. Our role is to help individuals understand their options after a car accident and request a free case evaluation with independent legal counsel who may be able to assist with their claim.
  </p>

  <h2>How the Process Works</h2>

  <p>
    After a car accident, many people are unsure where to begin. Insurance companies often move quickly, medical bills can start arriving immediately, and important evidence may be lost over time. This service exists to help simplify the first step.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>You submit a request for a free case evaluation through this website</li>
    <li>Your information is reviewed to determine whether an attorney may be able to assist</li>
    <li>If appropriate, you may be contacted by independent legal counsel to discuss your situation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What Happens After You Submit a Request</h2>

  <p>
    Submitting a request through this website does not create an attorney-client relationship. If an attorney contacts you, they will explain how Tennessee personal injury law may apply to your situation and whether they are able to represent you.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attorneys who handle car accident cases often work on a contingency fee basis, meaning legal fees may only be collected if compensation is recovered. Any fee arrangement is discussed directly between you and the attorney.
  </p>

  <h2>Educational and Informational Purpose</h2>

  <p>
    The information provided on this website is for general educational purposes only. Laws and legal outcomes vary based on individual facts, and no results are guaranteed.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you have been injured in a car accident in Memphis and are unsure of your next steps, requesting a free case evaluation may help you better understand your available options.
